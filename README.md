axe-crawler is a Node.js webcrawler which tests every page it can find in a single domain using the [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility testing library.

axe-crawler produces detailed reports of accessibility issues it finds on pages in the domain.

## Installation

From npm:
```
npm install -g axe-crawler
```

## Basic Usage

axe-crawler defaults to crawling through all links it can find WITHIN the provided doman name. If you use
```
axe-crawler mydomain.org
```
then axe-crawler will parse `http://mydomain.org` for all links it finds and build a queue of unique links.  It will then visit those links and look for new links to add to its queue.  Because it uses a Javascript Set to build the queue of unique links, it will only scrape each url once.

By default, axe-crawler ignores links that end in common media or document extensions (.mp3, .avi, .pdf, .docx, etc.)

When it reaches crawls through the domain to the specified depth (default: 5), or when it stops finding new links, it then uses selenium and axe-core to open a browser and test each link in the queue for accessibility at each specified viewPort resolution (default: mobile, tablet_vertical, tablet_horizontal, and desktop).  This means that each url will be visited a total of once + the number of viewPorts specified (default: 5 times).  In order to avoid overloading servers the selenium driven requests are done synchronously rather than asynchronously.

***Please be considerate in your use of this or any web scraping tool.  Don't point it at other people's domains without permission.  It is recommended to use this tool on testing/staging servers rather than production servers for obvious reasons.***

## Configuration

Most paramters of axe-crawler are configurable at the command line or with a JSON config file named `.axe-crawler.json` in the current directory.

### Command Line Options

Command line arguments passed to axe-crawler override config file settings and the default options.
```
--depth d
    Specify how many levels deep you want the crawler to scrape for new links.    Default: 5.

--check n
    Specify the number of URLs you want to actually test from the queue.  Useful for
    testing the crawler and seeing what links it finds without running the axe-core
    tests on every URL.  Default: undefined which checks all links in the queue.

--viewPorts viewportString
    Specify which viewPorts to use when running accessibility tests.  Useful for sites
    where visibile markup on mobile screen sizes differs substantially from other
    screen sizes.  Format is name:WIDTHxHEIGHT,... Default: mobile:360x640,
    table_vertical:768x1024,table_horizontal:1024x768,desktop:1440x900

--output outputFilePrefix
    Specify the prefix for your output file names which will be outputFilePrefix.html 
    for the summary report and outputFilePrefix.json for the raw data.  Default: 
    'reports'

--configFile filename
    Specify a config file different from the default .axecrawlerrc
```

### Config File Options

Config file should be named `.axe-crawler.json` and be in the current directory when axe-crawler is run.

```json
{
    "depth": 5,
    "check": 100,
    "output": "reports",
    "viewPorts": [
        {
            "name": "mobile",
            "width": 360,
            "height": 640
        },
        {
            "name": "tablet_vertical",
            "width": 768,
            "height": 1024
        },
        {
            "name": "tablet_horizontal",
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 768
        },
        {
            "name": "desktop",
            "width": 1440,
            "height": 900
        }
    ]
}
```

## Planned Features

* Better error reporting and handling esp. for bad configuration and broken links
* Verbose / quiet modes
* Oauth functionality for testing pages behind logins
